### ALCQ reasoner based on the tableau algorithm
This is a tableau-based reasoning algorithm for ALCQ description logic.
It is implemented in rust, but despite all the obstacles rust sets up to prevent unnecessary memory allocations, I managed to clone data everywhere possible and everywhere impossible. My only hope is that this smart-aleck compiler will optimize everything for me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
